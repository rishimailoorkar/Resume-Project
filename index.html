    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Hi, I am a Student from Bidar following my dreams
I have been freelancing as a graphic designer since I was 15, during my school days, for almost a year. Later, I collaborated with some of my friends and started our own content management agency, which ran successfully for almost two years.
I possess a wide range of competencies, such as graphic design, video editing, UI design, and social media management. All these come with approximately two to three years experience of working with local clients.
I built a content marketing firm that not only survived but flourished for almost 2 years. This fantastic opportunity gave me the chance to work with clients which boosted my interpersonal, leadership, and client management abilities- all invaluable skills from my school & college days.
As a lifelong film fan, I've always dreamed of writing and directing my own stories. Watching movies, breaking them down, and learning from the greats are all part of the process. With my enthusiasm for filmmaking and love for storytelling, I have been writing stories since my high school days.</p>
